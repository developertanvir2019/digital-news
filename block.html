        <h2 class="text-success">what is the deferent between Var let and const?</h2>
        <small class="text-muted">In the early days of JavaScript, there was only one way to declare variables and that
            was using the var
            keyword. However, there were some issues associated with variables declared using the var keyword so it was
            necessary to evolve new ways for variable declaration. With the advent of ES6, now developers are able to
            define variables according to their specific needs, thanks to two new keywords: let and const.

            All three of these three keywords have similarities in their syntax for declaring variables. However, they
            differ in their usage and scope, as detailed in the next section.</small>

    <div class="text-center container my-3 py-5">
        <h2 class="text-primary">what is the deferent between Array function and regular function?</h2>
        <small class="text-muted">Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible
            and callable. Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However,
            the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as
            constructor functions.</small>

        <h2 class="text-info">Why we use template string?</h2>
        <small class="text-muted">Template literals are a new feature introduced in ECMAScript 2015/ ES6. It provides an
            easy way to create multiline strings and perform string interpolation. Template literals are the string
            literals and allow embedded expressions. Before ES6, template literals were called as template
            strings.Template literals are sometimes informally called template strings, because they are used most
            commonly for string interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders).</small>
